Pelican repository comes with a good number of [themes](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes) to use when render you site/blog. Majority of the themes have [previews](http://www.pelicanthemes.com/). Here are a list of these I found interesting. The documentation part varies a lot from theme to theme. It will take a little time to figure it out if you are new to this. Check it out.


Theme: [voidy-bootstrap](https://github.com/robulouski/voidy-bootstrap/tree/83f4d802710bbfa20123a9b7f1921424e292ef53)  
Reason: It's influenced by a blog I follow [Practical Business Python](https://pbpython.com/)
